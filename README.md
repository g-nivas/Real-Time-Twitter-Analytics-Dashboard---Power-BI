# 📊 Twitter Analytics Dashboard - Internship Project

This repository contains my internship project developed using **Microsoft Power BI**, focusing on analyzing tweet engagement data to derive valuable business insights. The project showcases advanced dashboard-building skills with dynamic visualizations and real-time filters, demonstrating real-world applications of data analytics.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The objective of this internship project was to transform raw Twitter data into a visually interactive analytics dashboard. The dataset consisted of tweet metadata, engagement metrics, and content information.

Using Power BI, I built a set of dashboards tailored to specific analytical goals, including:
- Click distribution analysis
- Top-performing tweets identification
- Monthly engagement trend comparison

Each visualization was enriched with intelligent filters and visibility rules that mirror real business conditions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Power BI**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Power Query Editor**
- **Data Modeling & Transformations**
- **Bookmarks & Drill-down Features**

## 📈 Key Visualizations

### 1. Pie Chart with Drill-Down
- Displays the proportion of total clicks (URL clicks, user profile clicks, hashtag clicks) for tweets with **impressions > 500**.
- Drill-down feature enabled to show click breakdown by tweet.

### 2. Top 10 Tweets by Retweets & Likes
- Filters out tweets posted on weekends.
- Shown only between **3 PM and 5 PM IST**.
- Includes only tweets with:
  - Even number of impressions
  - Odd tweet dates
  - Word count < 30
- Displays the associated **user profiles**.

### 3. Monthly Engagement Rate Trend
- Line chart comparing average engagement of tweets with media vs. without media.
- Visibility limited to:
  - **3 PM – 5 PM IST** and **7 AM – 11 AM IST**
- Additional filters:
  - Even engagement values
  - Odd tweet dates
  - Character count > 20
  - Tweets cleaned to remove words containing the letter **'C'**

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Developed hands-on expertise in Power BI reporting and real-time filtering.
- Strengthened knowledge of DAX for complex logic implementation.
- Improved data storytelling through interactive visuals.
- Learned how to translate business rules into technical visualizations.

## 📌 Conclusion

This project was part of my internship, where I applied practical data analytics skills to solve real-world problems using Power BI. The result is a clean, intelligent dashboard that enables quick, impactful insights from Twitter data.
